This README file was generated on March 07 2022 by Andres Martinez.

This work was supported by the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) grant #P42ES013661.  The funding sponsor did not have any role in study design; in collection, analysis, and/or interpretation of data; in creation of the dataset; and/or in the decision to submit this data for publication or deposit it in a repository.


This README file describes a revised version of scripts for calculating air-water PCB fluxes used in this paper: Martinez, A., A. M. Awad, N. J. Herkert and K. C. Hornbuckle (2019). Determination of PCB fluxes from Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal using dual-deployed air and water passive samplers. Environmental Pollution Volume 244, January 2019, Pages 469-476 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749118331269

The data can be downloaded from PANGAEA, https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.894908, using the R package pangaear (https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2022-01-01/web/packages/pangaear/pangaear.pdf).

The scripts are developed for individual deployment times, so in the scripts the deployment time (1 to 9) needs to be changed for both air and water concentrations, as well as for the meteorological parameters.
